The field of industrial robotics can be defined as the study, design and use of robots for the execution of industrial processes.
There are 5 types of robots:
Manipulative robots. Learning or repetition robots. Computer robots. Intelligent (experimental) robots. Micro and nanorobots. 5. FANUC M-2000iA/1700L The strongest 6 axis robot on the market, it comes with a handling capacity up to 2.</description></item><item><title>The new era of wearable technology</title><link>https://st3p.github.io/post/newtatoos/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://st3p.github.io/post/newtatoos/</guid><description>DuoSkin This tattoo is able to control and act as a interface with different devices. A collaboration between MIT and Microsoft had developed this tattoo&amp;rsquo;s that are touch-sensitive interface.
Duoskin is the name of the revolutionized idea of a tattoo, this technology is wireless and can communicate with different gadgets. It can be used to track different aspects of the body as temperature, without a doubt this is just the beginning of a new era of wearable technology.</description></item><item><title>Mini R2-D2</title><link>https://st3p.github.io/post/mini-r2-d2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://st3p.github.io/post/mini-r2-d2/</guid><description>Frame Design The design was made taking into account the multiple vents and panels of the robot seen on the films, so in a future it could have space to accommodate little systems for their movement. The measurements took into account to make the frame where taken from the website wwww.astromech.com
Head mechanisim Solidworks design The operation of this mechanism is simple it consist on a motor in the center of the head which gives action to a axial gear that moves smoothly thanks to the help of a lazy Susan that is attached to the from and the base of the head.</description></item><item><title>Recreation of the movement of a creature</title><link>https://st3p.github.io/post/simulation-dragon/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://st3p.github.io/post/simulation-dragon/</guid><description>simulation of mechanisms using Solidworks. The Mechanism used to recreate the movement is the slider crank. This Mechanism is one of the most used systems in the mathematical field, it is an arrangement of parts designed to make a rotary straight motion movement as the type of movement that makes a piston engine, so me can define it as one type of four bar linkages which has three revolute joints and one sliding joint.</description></item><item><title>Power Supply</title><link>https://st3p.github.io/post/powersupply/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://st3p.github.io/post/powersupply/</guid><description>material MATERIAL CUANTITY MODEL NUMBER

Slider-cranks are a commonly used type of mechanism translating a rotary movement into a linear one, or the other way around. In this lab session, three slider-crank variations were modelled using ADAMS software. Their movements were simulated and analyzed to find the velocities and position for certain input angles. The obtained results were compared to manual computations using the vector loop equations.</description></item><item><title>Clock with logic gates</title><link>https://st3p.github.io/post/clock/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://st3p.github.io/post/clock/</guid><description>12hrs clock using logic gates The 74LS90 decade counter is a counter that is capable of dividing the frequency each time it is connected with one another, therefore it was used to make it send a signal synchronized with the clock pulse so that the desired account, in addition a 74LS47 decoder was connected for the display outputs.
The logic circuits that were used for the construction of the clock were: 74LS90, counter to decades, to count the seconds and minutes; 74LS47, BCD decoder, to decode the counter outputs to outputs for the 7 segment display; 74LS190, synchronous BCD counter, to generate the sequence of the hours (1 to 12); 74LS73, JK flip-flop, to display if it is AM OR PM; 74LS08, 2-input AND; 74LS00, 2-input NAND; finally, 74LS04, NOT.</description></item><item><title>Elevated 4 link mechanism</title><link>https://st3p.github.io/post/4link/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://st3p.github.io/post/4link/</guid><description>In 1819 the world was going through a transition that nowadays we call the industrial revolution, the challenge in this era was to make the machines simpler, change most of the systems for others more simpler and easier, mechanisms for converting rotary into linear motion were the ones that were investigated the most, and the accuracy of the system to development was important for the machines that were going to be applied in.</description></item><item><title>Shift Registrers</title><link>https://st3p.github.io/post/shiftregistrers/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://st3p.github.io/post/shiftregistrers/</guid><description>Screen Saver: Basic Scroll: The Mouse For the first part, it was decided to use six JK flip flops (74LS76) connecting their outputs to the J inputs and the negated outputs to the K inputs, for the first flip flop a two input OR (74LS32) connected to the output of the last flip flop and to a pulse signal, so that, together with the clock signal connected to all the flip flops, a high signal would be passed through all the flip flops and with the outputs in parallel connect them to the display.</description></item><item><title>About me</title><link>https://st3p.github.io/about/about/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://st3p.github.io/about/about/</guid><description>Header 2 Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
