Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.
Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly challenging today because there are more devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative.
Advancements on cybersecurity Blockchain The digital ledger allows for the secure sharing of information and identity authentication, without the typical risks of exposing data to outsiders.</description></item><item><title>Unhackable Internet</title><link>https://st3p.github.io/articles/internet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://st3p.github.io/articles/internet/</guid><description>An internet based on quantum physics will soon enable inherently secure communication. A team at Delft University of Technology, is building a network connecting four cities in the Netherlands entirely by means of quantum technology. Messages sent over this network will be unhackable.
The Delft network, will be the first to transmit information between cities using quantum techniques from end to end. The technology relies on a quantum behavior of atomic particles called entanglement.</description></item><item><title>Smart Materials</title><link>https://st3p.github.io/articles/smartmaterials/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://st3p.github.io/articles/smartmaterials/</guid><description>What are smart materials? A smart material is an object that holds a property that is susceptible to change with the introduction of an external stimulus. This change must be either tangible or visible for the material to qualify for ‘smart’ status. These changes can include:
Electrical Chemical Thermal Mechanical Magnetic The definition of smart materials has been expanded recently to include any materials that may not display a physical change, but do hold electronic functionality.</description></item><item><title>Smart Materials</title><link>https://st3p.github.io/post/smartmaterials/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://st3p.github.io/post/smartmaterials/</guid><description>What are smart materials?
