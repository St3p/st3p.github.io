A smart material is an object that holds a property that is susceptible to change with the introduction of an external stimulus.

CNC are manufacturing machines that run on numeric controlled programs to manufacture parts of high precision for the industry. The CNC uses different software&amp;rsquo;s to control all of the machines motions as the spindle speed and the axes movements. This machines uses a special language called “G-Code”.
Before the CNC Machines the manufacture parts were done manually by machinists, they were less precise and took a lot more time than tne CNC the be done.</description></item><item><title>CNC Machines</title><link>https://st3p.github.io/post/cnc-machines/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://st3p.github.io/post/cnc-machines/</guid><description>What is a CNC?

These machines were taken from the ruins and made into a monument by the Ontario Society for Industrial Archaeology.
