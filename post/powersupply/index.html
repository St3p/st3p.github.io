</code></pre><h2 id=procedure>Procedure<a href=#procedure class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>At first, the circuit was generated in the Livewire simulator to check that it worked properly, as shown in the following image:</p><img src=/img/livewirecircuit.png alt=Circuit class=center style=border-radius:8px><p>Subsequently, the circuit was generated on the breadboard according to the previously simulated circuit. Once the correct forward voltages were achieved from each of the regulators experimentally, we were able to generate the circuit for printing with Autodesk&rsquo;s Eagle application, as shown below:</p><img src=/img/powersupply-eagle.png alt=Circuit class=center style=border-radius:8px><p>After having arranged the components and wired them so that they do not touch or stick together, we print the circuit on photographic paper. Having already printed the circuit on the photographic paper, it was placed on the phenolic plate and ironed for approximately 30 minutes so that the impression will remain on the phenolic plate. The circuit was immediately marked on the plate with the black Sharpie down, it was started to put it in the plastic tray with 70% ferric chloride and 30% hot water for approximately 20 minutes so that the copper was eliminated in the parts that did not. they connected. After this time, the plate was cleaned with a little thinner so that the pure copper circuit remained on the plate. The result is shown below after following the aforementioned process:</p><img src=/img/pcb.jpg alt=Circuit class=center style=border-radius:8px><p>Then, the components were placed in their proper positions according to the simulation that was done in Eagle, the components were soldered and solder was filled in the spaces of the circuit where it was not well reflected to ensure that it would conduct.</p><img src=/img/powersupply-solder.png alt=Circuit class=center style=border-radius:8px><p>Finally, the board with the components and working properly were put in a plastic box with holes for the respective voltage and potentiometer outputs.</p><img src=/img/powersupply-results.jpg alt=Circuit class=center style=border-radius:8px></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=https://st3p.github.io/post/simulation-dragon/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
