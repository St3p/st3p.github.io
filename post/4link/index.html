<span class=post-author>:: Stephanie Zepeda</span></div><div class=post-content><div><p>In 1819 the world was going through a transition that nowadays we call the industrial
revolution, the challenge in this era was to make the machines simpler, change most of
the systems for others more simpler and easier, mechanisms for converting rotary into
linear motion were the ones that were investigated the most, and the accuracy of the
system to development was important for the machines that were going to be applied in.
In the middle of all this was James Watt, he developed mechanisms that were
ingenious and simple, like the Watt linkage, in which the central moving point of the linkage
is constrained to travel on an approximation to a straight line. Now a days it is used mainly in
the cars suspension. The most shocking of this idea was that he developed it in a letter to
Mattew Boulton.</p><p>#Methodology</p><p>To simulate the mechanism in fig.1 using solidworks and adams and plot the
trajectory of point P, for this we have the following measures for each of the links in
fig. 1:</p><img src=/img/4link.png class=left><pre><code>L1 249.50     L3 219.04   A 400
L2 150.205    L4 270      B 237.11
</code></pre><p>In adams the simplest way to make the mechanism is using markers for
reference, while on solidworks we have to make each of the parts separately and then
unite them in an assembly, for both of them we have make an animation after plotting
the P plot.</p><p>#results</p><p>From the simulation in adams (fig. 3), solidworks (fig. 4), Matlab (fig. 5)
