The first part consisted of simulating a mouse moving, that is, turning on a segment of the display at the same time with a given sequence; the second part, simulated a mouse growing until it became a worm, therefore, the display had to be turned on segment by segment according to the sequence given; for the third part, we had to simulate a viper in motion with two displays, turning on three segments per movement; finally, in the fourth part, a ball was simulated that bounced and traveled through nine displays, lighting four segments at the same time with a certain sequence."><meta property="og:url" content="https://st3p.github.io/posts/shiftregistrers/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Shift Registrers"><meta property="og:image" content="https://st3p.github.io/img/Shift-Registers.png"><meta property="og:image:width" content="2048"><meta property="og:image:height" content="1024"><meta property="article:published_time" content="2019-04-10 00:00:00 +0000 UTC"></head><body class=green><div class="container center headings--one-size"><header class=header><div class=header__inner><div class=header__logo><a href=/><div class=logo>My Blog</div></a></div><div class=menu-trigger>menu</div></div><nav class=menu><ul class="menu__inner menu__inner--desktop"><li><a href=about/about>About me</a></li><li><a href=/proyects>proyects</a></li></ul><ul class="menu__inner menu__inner--mobile"><li><a href=about/about>About me</a></li><li><a href=/proyects>proyects</a></li></ul></nav></header><div class=content><div class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://st3p.github.io/posts/shiftregistrers/>Shift Registrers</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2019-04-10</span>

As in the second part, the clock input was connected with an AND with two inputs (74LS08) and a dip switch to be able to pause the sequence.</p><img src=/img/viper.png alt=Circuit class=center style=border-radius:8px>

In the same way, a dip switch was connected to the resets of all the flip flops in order to stop the sequence and restart it.</p><img src=/img/ball.png alt=Circuit class=center style=border-radius:8px>
