<span class=post-author>:: Stephanie Zepeda</span></div><img src=https://st3p.github.io/img/sm.jpg class=post-cover alt="Smart Materials"><div class=post-content><div><h1 id=what-are-smart-materials>What are smart materials?<a href=#what-are-smart-materials class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h1><p>A smart material is an object that holds a property that is susceptible to change with the introduction of an external stimulus. This change must be either tangible or visible for the material to qualify for ‘smart’ status. These changes can include:</p><ul><li>Electrical</li><li>Chemical</li><li>Thermal</li><li>Mechanical</li><li>Magnetic</li></ul><p>The definition of smart materials has been expanded recently to include any materials that may not display a physical change, but do hold electronic functionality.</p><p>Material scientists and smart materials
Common examples of products that hold intelligent materials include:</p><ul><li>Mood rings</li><li>Responsive glasses that darken when in direct sunlight</li><li>Colour-changing mugs</li></ul><p>While these may not be considered particularly groundbreaking, material scientists are continuing their studies to ascertain potential applications of other materials.</p><h1 id=what-are-the-problems-with-smart-materials>What are the problems with smart materials?<a href=#what-are-the-problems-with-smart-materials class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h1><p>Although the applications of smart materials (both current and futuristic) are far-reaching, some drawbacks are preventing a heavier reliance on them, such as:</p><ul><li>Delicacy</li><li>Instability</li><li>Diminished performance over time</li><li>Incorporation difficulties</li><li>Toxicity</li><li>Costs</li><li>Future applications of smart materials</li></ul><h1 id=aerial-industry>Aerial industry<a href=#aerial-industry class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h1><p>The application of smart materials will enable the wings of aircraft to be more flexible thanks to shape-memory alloys. The outer elements of an aircraft will become more skin-like in that they will have to be strong, hard and rigid, yet flexible.</p><p>The theory behind this design stems from Da Vinci’s flying machine, an example of a historic smart material theory being realised with tomorrow’s modern technology. The ‘skin’ of the plane will also have self-healing properties, even when the aircraft is in flight; thanks to the introduction of self-healing plastics.</p><h1 id=energy-sector>Energy Sector<a href=#energy-sector class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h1><p>The implementation of printed photovoltaic cells will allow the energy sector to take solar panels to the next level. Photovoltaic cells can be painted onto any surface, in any shape. These cells can transform sunlight and heat into electricity. This will undoubtedly have a positive impact on residential properties and, while this solution is not yet commercially-ready, the industry is certainly getting closer.</p><h1 id=mobile-industry>Mobile industry<a href=#mobile-industry class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h1><p>There are LG devices that already contain self-healing materials, restoring any scratches that occur on the back of the device. However, research is currently taking place to move this on to another level. The aim is to invent self-healing glass (for screens) and lithium batteries that can be housed within mobile devices.</p><h1 id=automotive-industry>Automotive industry<a href=#automotive-industry class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h1><p>Windscreen chips become cracked due to water molecules within the air mixing with the chip in the glass, breaking it down and worsening the condition. Crack-resistant glass is currently in development that reacts well with airborne water molecules, resulting in the glass healing over time instead of deteriorating.</p><p>As material scientists continue to study intelligent materials, further future applications will be discovered. The opportunity within the energy, automotive, medical and even military sectors are sure to benefit from the technological advances available through the incorporation of smart materials.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FgrIDibPmJo?autoplay=1" style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>© 2020 Powered by <a href=http://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></span>
